	Im from Westside California, they run up on ya
Ask you where you from and check yo tats under yo clothin'
Hustla, go hard make sure my knot swollen
Fuck it, say the wrong hood bullets explodin'
I trust few, people these days cuz that's golden
I seen niggas get killed for who they roll with and chose to
Keep inside they
Circle satan sittin' on your sofa
Same nigga that shot you was the one you used to smoke with
Cold shit, my whole clique notorious
You've heard of us, six owes is murderas
You still servin' clucks, jealous nigga you broke as fuck
Yo bitch on my nuts, spillin' patron out my cup
She can't get enough, buffer me down as I puff on the finest kush
They say I be doin' too much, I just do my stuff
Yeah, I just do my stuff</p></div>
